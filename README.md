## Project Overview

Customer churn refers to the percentage of customers who stop using a companyâ€™s product or service during a certain timeframe. This project uses machine learning to predict which customers are at risk of leaving (churning) based on historical data. Understanding churn helps businesses take action to retain customers, improve services, and maximize revenue.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is **Telco Customer Churn**, a dataset provided by IBM, which includes information about customers, such as:

- Customer demographics (e.g., age, gender, etc.)
- Subscription details (e.g., contract type, payment method)
- Account details (e.g., tenure, usage)
- Whether or not the customer churned (target variable)

The dataset is stored in the `Telco_Customer_Churn.csv` file and is loaded and preprocessed in the code to prepare it for model training.
